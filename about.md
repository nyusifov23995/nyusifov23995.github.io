        <p>
          Before beginning my undergraduate studies, I successfully completed the
          <strong>English for Academic Purposes Program (EAPP)</strong> at ADA University.
          The program strengthened my academic English in reading, writing, listening, and speaking,
          with a strong emphasis on critical thinking and research-based writing.
